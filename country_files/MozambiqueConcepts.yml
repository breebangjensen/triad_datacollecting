I grouped white portuguese and mixed together as its hard to distinguish them and it seems mostly based on skin colour/self identificantion but varies wildly. Also I have got all sorts of estimates for this and varies quite wildly by time but also by estimate.... but at a low it is around .9% and as high as 5%
